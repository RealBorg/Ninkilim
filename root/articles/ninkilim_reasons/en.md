# Ninkilim: Reasons to Use

The primary reason why Ninkilim was created is that Twitter has been turned 
from a neutral social media network into a highly biased political platform 
which is boosting right-wing content, racism and islamophobia and which is 
silencing voices which go against it's agenda.

When Twitter was launched in July 2006 there was a chronological timeline 
and a API which allowed developers to create applications and researchers 
to analyze what users were posting.

Since then Twitter has replaced the chronological timeline with algorithms 
deciding which tweets you see and if your tweets are getting seen, has added 
advertising, restricted freedom of speech and access to it's API.

Many users have already moved on to other social networks leaving the content 
they have created behind for X to monetize or have deactivated / deleted their 
accounts. 

Although European GDPR gives the users the right to request a copy of their 
data and X provides such a download, there is currently not much use for it 
except to view the archive of your Tweets on your computer.

Ninkilim empowers you to import the data from this archive and display your 
tweets on your own server / website, thereby removing the restructions placed 
on the X API and making your content available by a simple and open JSON and 
XML interface.
